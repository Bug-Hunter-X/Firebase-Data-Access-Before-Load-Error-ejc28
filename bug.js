The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. This can happen if you use asynchronous functions that access the snapshot within a callback that's called before the data is ready. For example, if you use the `get()` method to retrieve data, you should make sure that you handle the promise it returns appropriately, using `.then()` to access the data only after the promise has resolved.
